# Kafka Basics

This repository contains materials from an academic project and a student-led workshop introducing Apache Kafka.

## 🚀 About the Project

As part of an academic project, I worked with Kafka to explore its fundamentals, architecture, and behavior under failure scenarios. Later, I took the initiative to lead a workshop titled **"Introduction to Kafka"**, where I walked students through the basics of Kafka supported by configuration and testing senarios.
